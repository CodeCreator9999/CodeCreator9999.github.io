## Project description

A complete chess game that runs in the terminal. It allows all legal chess moves including en passant and castling. This was my final project for Object Oriented Programming

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

cd ChessGameCopy
javac ChessGameCopy
java ChessGameCopy
```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.

After Running the Program (figure 1) shows the bootup screen of the ChessGame. The user is prompted to choose a move after user chooses a move it will show you the move (figure 2). If the move is invalid the program will say choose a new move invalid see (figure 3).
